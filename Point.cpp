/**
 ** Add functions to the 2D Point class (Point/ or Point.cc) so that the following calls will work:
 **
 ** p.distance(q) returns distance between two points p and q
 **
 ** p.angle(q)    returns angle in radians between p and q (search "dot product")
 **
 ** p.magnitude() returns distance of p from the origin
 **
 ** p.angle()     returns angle in radians of p from the x axis
 **
 ** p.area()      eturns area of circle with radius p.magnitude()
 ** Add statements to main() to test the functions and display the results.
